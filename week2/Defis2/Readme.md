# Challenge 2: Getting unique values

- Repository: `java_week_2`

- Type of Challenge: `Learning`

- Team challenge : `solo`

  

## The Mission

Read in the csv file about effects-of-covid-19-on-trade. Each column has a set of unique values. List all of 
these unique values for each column. There are different ways of doing this, but you are required to use the
streaming api to do so. 

Tip: there is a collection in the Java language that can help you win a lot of time when it comes down
to finding unique values. And also remember to disregard the first line!
